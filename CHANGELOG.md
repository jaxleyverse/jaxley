# 1.0.0 (pre-release)

⚠️ Version `1.0.0` makes multiple changes which might brake your code when upgrading. 
Please read
[this how-to guide](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guide/upgrade_to_v1.html)
on how to upgrade to version `1.0.0`.

### 🧩 New features

- A larger and more flexible set of synapse dynamics (#748, @michaeldeistler):
```python
from jaxley.synapses import CurrentSynapse, ConductanceSynapse, DynamicSynapse, IonotropicSynapse
```
- `Fire` channels now implement a surrogate gradient (#735, @alexpejovic)
- New `SpikeSynapse` added, which detects `Fire` channel spikes (#735, @alexpejovic)
- New `AlphaSynapse` added (#764, @michaeldeistler)
- Channels can now have an `init_params` method. You can then initialize parameters
depending on one another with:
```python
cell.init_params()
```
- Methods to simplify assigning recordings to their location in the cell or network
(#750, @michaeldeistler):
```python
recs = jx.integrate(cell)
cell.write_recordings(recs)
print(cell.branch(0).comp(1).recording("v"))  # Only the recording in branch 0, comp 1.
```
- Synapses can now use the states and parameters of pre- and post-synaptic
compartments (#765, @michaeldeistler)
- new `neuron` backend for the SWC reader: `jx.read_swc(..., backend="neuron")` imports through
NEURON's own `Import3d`, so it reproduces NEURON's compartment length, radius, area and volume
exactly. It doubles as a reference for the other backends.
- non-uniform discretization at import time: `build_compartment_graph(..., ncomp=callable)` takes
a per-branch rule, e.g. the d-lambda rule.
- `set_ncomp()` accepts one value per branch, e.g. `cell.branch("all").set_ncomp([3, 5, 1])`.
- `to_graph()` and `from_graph()` are exact inverses, so `set_ncomp()`, `morph_delete()` and
`morph_connect()` now rebuild the module from a graph instead of splicing `DataFrame`s in place.
`to_graph(module, channels=False, synapses=False)` exports the bare morphology.

### API changes

- Synapses now take different arguments in order to be able to fetch the pre-
  and post-synaptic states of the network (#735, @alexpejovic)
- Removed the `TanhConductanceSynapse` (#748, @michaeldeistler). Replace it with:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jaxley.synapses import ConductanceSynapse
connect(..., ConductanceSynapse(jnp.tanh))
```
- Removed the `TanhRateSynapse` (#748, @michaeldeistler). Replace it with:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jaxley.synapses import CurrentSynapse
connect(..., CurrentSynapse(jnp.tanh))
```
- Synapses have a new API (#765, @michaeldeistler). The `update_states` method and the
`compute_current` method should both receive all of the following arguments, in that
order:
```python
self,
synapse_states: dict[str, Array],
synapse_params: dict[str, Array],
pre_voltage: Array,
post_voltage: Array,
pre_states: dict[str, Array],
post_states: dict[str, Array],
pre_params: dict[str, Array],
post_params: dict[str, Array],
delta_t: float,
```
- Channels have a new API (#766, @michaeldeistler). The `update_states` method and the
`compute_current` method should both receive all of the following arguments, in that
order:
```python
self,
channel_states: dict[str, Array],
channel_params: dict[str, Array],
voltage: Array,
delta_t: float,
```
- The default `Na`, `K`, and `Leak` channels have been changed (#766,
@michaeldeistler). To recover the old channels, do:
```text
pip install jaxley-mech
```
```python
from jaxley_mech.channels.pospischil import Na, K, Leak
```
- All Pospischil type channels have been moved to the `jaxley-mech` repository (#766,
@michaeldeistler). To get access to these channels, do:
```text
pip install jaxley-mech
```
```python
from jaxley_mech.channels.pospischil import Na, K, Leak, CaL, CaT, M
```
- `cell.recordings` has been renamed to `cell.rec_info` (#750, @michaeldeistler)
- Remove `solve_inf_gate_exponential`. Replace with `exponential_euler` (#766,
@michaeldeistler)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- compartment centers are now the point at half the compartment's arc length, rather than the
midpoint of the chord between its ends. This lead to notable impact on simulation results for 
long compartments of curved branches.
- branch tracing no longer depends on the order of nodes in the SWC file.

### ⚡ Performance

- reading `morph_l5pc_with_axon.swc` is ~6x faster (at `ncomp=1`).
- `set_ncomp()` over a whole cell drops from 829 s to 1.6 s (~500x faster), since it rebuilds `nodes` in a single
pass rather than re-splicing per branch.

### 🛠️ Internal updates

- the SWC import is now five inspectable steps: `swc_to_pandas()` (edit SWC on file level) -> `swc_to_nx()`
 (edit SWC-graph; i.e. smooth branches) -> `build_compartment_graph()` (inspect compartment graph) 
 -> `from_graph()`, each usable on its own.
- The code is simpler, much more explicit about the choices it makes (i.e. mostly SWC order agnostic) and 
  reduces linecount by ~10% (Further line count reduction should be possible).
- `to_graph()` moved from `jaxley.modules.base` to `jaxley.io.graph`, and `graph_vis()` to
`jaxley.utils.plot_utils` as `plot_comp_graph()`. Simpler dependencies.
- the `initialize` argument of `set_ncomp()` is deprecated and will be removed in `v1.1.0`; it no
longer skips any work.
- all three backends are now ground truthed against NEURON on compartment length, radius, area and volume.
Compartments are now matched geometrically (by center coords), independent of index ordering.
- the previous reader is kept as `jaxley.io.legacy` (`backend="legacy"`) as a backup option until the new 
reader has proven reliable.

# 0.13.0

### 🧩 New features

- Add utilities to process the ``all_states`` dictionary such that it only contains
"true" ODE states (i.e., it removes branchpoint states, membrane states that are NaN
because the channel does not exist there, and ionic currents). In addition, the
utilities can flatten the states to a vector (#719, @matthijspals, @michaeldeistler):
```python
import jaxley as jx
from jaxley.integrate import build_init_and_step_fn
from jaxley.utils.dynamics import build_dynamic_state_utils

cell = jx.Cell()
params = cell.get_parameters()

init_fn, step_fn = build_init_and_step_fn(cell)
remove_observables, add_observables, flatten, unflatten = build_dynamic_state_utils(cell)

all_states, all_params = init_fn(params)

dynamic_states = flatten(remove_observables(all_states))
recovered_all_states = add_observables(unflatten(dynamic_states), all_params, delta_t=0.025)
```

### 📚 Documentation

- Improved documentation for ``build_init_and_step_fn``
(#719, @matthijspals, @michaeldeistler)
- Improved examples in documentation (#759, @michaeldeistler)
- Manually remove some functions from the documentation (#759, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.12.0

### 🧩 New features

- Exponential Euler solver (#743, @michaeldeistler):
```python
jx.integrate(cell, solver="exp_euler")
```
This solver is slow on CPU, but can be very performant on GPU, especially when length,
radius, axial resistivity, and capacitance do not change across simulations (i.e.,
they are no parameters). In that case, the transition matrix for exponential Euler can
be precomputed (and it is no longer computed at every call to `jx.integrate`):
```python
cell.customize_solver_exp_euler(
    exp_euler_transition=cell.build_exp_euler_transition_matrix(delta_t)
)  # Pre-compute the update matrix. Has to be rerun for new values of radius, l, ra, C.
jx.integrate(cell, solver="exp_euler")
```
- Forward Euler solver for branched morphologies (#743, @michaeldeistler).

### 🛠️ Internal updates

-  separate getting the currents from `get_all_states()` (#727, @michaeldeistler). To
restore the previous behaviour, do:
```python
states = cell.get_all_states(pstate)
states = cell.append_channel_currents_to_states(states, all_params, delta_t)
```

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- bugfix for `cell.vis(..., type="morph")` (#725, @michaeldeistler, thanks to
Elisabeth Galyo for reporting)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- bugfix for `.delete()` when multiple channels have the same `current_name` or a
shared parameter/state (#713, @michaeldeistler)
- safe softplus, use linear function above certain threshold. This avoids an unwanted
clipping  operation due to the save_exp (#714 @matthijspals)

### 📚 Documentation

for reporting)
- update tutorial on building channel and synapse models: now includes pitfalls and
recommendations (#723, @michaeldeistler)

@michaeldeistler)

### 📚 Documentation

- add an example on fitting a morphologically detailed cell with gradient descent (#705,
@michaeldeistler)


# 0.11.3

### 🛠️ Internal updates

-  follow jax typing practices with Array and ArrayLike (#693, @alexpejovic)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- fix for networks that mix point neurons and morphologically detailed neurons (#702,
@michaeldeistler)
- carry over groups from constituents of a module (e.g., `jx.Cell` groups get carried
over to `jx.Network`) (#703, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.11.2

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Bugfix for `Network`s on `GPU`: since `v0.9.0`, networks had been very slow on GPU
because the voltage equations of cells had been processed in sequence, not in parallel.
This is now solved, giving a large speed-up for networks consisting of many cells (#691,
@michaeldeistler, thanks to @VENOM314 for reporting)

### 📚 Documentation

- Remove all content from the old mkdocs documentation website (#689, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.11.1

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- bugfix for `set_ncomp()` when the cell consists of a single branch (#686,
@michaeldeistler)

### 🛠️ Internal updates

- fix all typos in the codebase by using the `typos` project (#682, @alexpejovic)


# 0.11.0

### 🧩 New features

- simple conductance synapse added (#659, @kyralianaka)

### 📚 Documentation

- add a how-to guide on converting `NMODL` files to `Jaxley`, see
[here](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guide/import_channels_from_neuron.html)
(#669, @michaeldeistler, special thanks to @r-makarov for building the tool)

### 🛠️ Internal updates

- changes to how the membrane area from SWC files is computed when the radius within a
compartment is not constant. This fix can have an impact on simulation results. The
updated computation of membrane area matches that of the NEURON simulator (#662,
@michaeldeistler, thanks to @VENOM314 for reporting).
- remove the `custom` SWC reader (which had been deprecated in `v0.9.0`, #662,
@michaeldeistler).
- fix bug in the `.ncomp` attribute after `set_ncomp()` had been run (#676,
@manuelgloeckler)


# 0.10.0

### 🧩 New features

- functionality to compute the pathwise distance between compartments (#648,
@michaeldeistler):
```python
from jaxley.morphology import distance_pathwise
path_dists = distance_pathwise(cell.soma.branch(0).comp(0), cell)
cell.nodes["path_dist_from_soma"] = path_dists
```

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- fixed synapse recording indices to be within type (#643, @kyralianaka)
- Fix inheriting from a Module #590 (#642, @jnsbck)

### 🛠️ Internal updates

- `module.distance()` is now deprecated in favor of `jx.morphology.distance_direct()`
(#648, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.9.0

### ✨ Highlights

- This PR implements a new solver, which is now used by default (#625,
@michaeldeistler). The new solver has the following advantages:
  - Much lower runtime. Across several morphologies, we get a 20% runtime speedup on
    CPU and a 50% runtime speedup on GPU.
  - Almost zero compile time. We get a 50x compile time speedup on CPU and a 3x compile
    time speedup on GPU.
- Utility to delete parts of a morphology (#612, @michaeldeistler):
```python
from jaxley.morphology import morph_delete
cell = morph_delete(cell.branch([1, 2]))
```
- Utility to connect two cells into a single cell (#612, @michaeldeistler):
```python
from jaxley.morphology import morph_connect
cell = morph_connect(cell1.branch(1).loc(0.0), cell2.branch(2).loc(1.0))
```

### 🧩 New features

- the default SWC reader has changed. To use the previous SWC reader, run
`jx.read_swc(..., backend="custom")`. However, note that we will remove this reader
in the future. If the new SWC reader is causing issues for you, please open an issue
(#612, @michaeldeistler)
- radiuses are now integrated across SWC coordinates, not interpolated
(#612, @michaeldeistler)
- remove pin of `JAX` version. New `JAX` versions (`JAX>=0.6.0`) resolve slow CPU
runtime, see [here](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues/26145) (#623, @michaeldeistler)
- running the `d_lambda` rule is now much faster, see
[the how-to guide](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guide/set_ncomp.html)
(#625, @michaeldeistler)

### 📚 Documentation

- Introduce the `how-to guide` on the website (#612, @michaeldeistler)
- reorganize the advanced tutorials into subgroups (#612, @michaeldeistler)
- split the morphology handling tutorials into two notebooks (#612, @michaeldeistler)

### 🛠️ Internal updates

- improvements to graph-backend for more flexibility in modifying morphologies (#613,
@michaeldeistler)
- `jx.read_swc()` now ignores `type_id > 4` by default. This ensures compatibility
with flywire, which highjacks `type_id > 4` to indicate synaptic contacts (#612,
@michaeldeistler)
- remove root compartment for SWC files (#613, @michaeldeistler)
- enable traversing compartmentalized graph for optimizing solve order (#613,
@michaeldeistler)
- `._comp_edges` are being tracked in the `View` (#621, @michaeldeistler)
- introduce `._branchpoints_` attribute and track in the `View` (#612, @michaeldeistler)
- `pre_global_comp_index` and `post_global_comp_index` are no longer part of `.edges`
by default. To get them, do `net.copy_node_property_to_edges("global_comp_index")`
(#625, @michaeldeistler)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- `ChainTransform` forward now working as mirror to inverse (#628, @kyralianaka)
- allow `data_set` with vectors of values (#606, @chaseking)

### 🎉 New Contributors

- @chaseking made their first contribution in #606


# 0.8.2

- enable intersections of groups, e.g. `net.exc.soma` (#608, @michaeldeistler)
- allow ion diffusion to be jitted (#609, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.8.1

- remove `delete_channel()` (#604, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.8.0

### 🧩 New features

- add leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (#564, @jnsbck), Izhikevich neurons, and
rate-based neurons (#601, @michaeldeistler)

### 🛠️ Minor updates

- make `delta` and `v_th` in `IonotropicSynapse` trainable parameters (#599, @jnsbck)
- make random postsnaptic compartment selection optional in connectivity functions
(#489, @kyralianaka)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fix bug for `groups` when `.set_ncomp` was run (#587, @michaeldeistler)
- allow `.distance` to be jitted (#603, @michaeldeistler)


# 0.7.0

### 🧩 New Features

- Allow ion diffusion with `cell.diffuse()` and add tutorials (#438, @michaeldeistler):
```python
from jaxley.channels import CaNernstReversal
from jaxley.pumps import CaFaradayConcentrationChange

cell.insert(CaFaradayConcentrationChange())
cell.insert(CaNernstReversal())
cell.diffuse("CaCon_i")
cell.set("axial_diffusion_CaCon_i", 1.0)
```
- Introduce ion pumps (#438, @michaeldeistler)

### 🛠️ Minor changes

- rename `delete_channel()` to `delete()` (#438, @michaeldeistler)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fix for simulation of morphologies with inhomogeneous numbers of compartments (#438,
@michaeldeistler)
- Bugfix for types assigned by SWC reader when soma is traced by a single point (#582,
@Kartik-Sama, @michaeldeistler).

### Code health

- add new release workflow (#588, @jnsbck)
- update FAQ and tutorials (#593, @michaeldeistler)
- make random post compartment selection optional in connectivity functions (#489,
@kyralianaka)

### 🎉 New Contributors

- @Kartik-Sama made their first contribution in #582


# 0.6.2

- also remove `nseg` from tutorials (#580, @jnsbck)


# 0.6.1

- Fixup for failing readthedocs build of v0.6.0 (#579, @michaeldeistler)
- Deprecate `nseg` in favor of `ncomp`.


# 0.6.0

### Pin of JAX version

Installing `Jaxley` will no longer install the newest version of `JAX`. We realized
that, on CPU, with version `jax==0.4.32` or newer, simulation time in `Jaxley` is 10x
slower and gradient time is 5x slower as compared to older versions of JAX. Newer
versions of `JAX` can be made equally fast as older versions by setting
`os.environ['XLA_FLAGS'] = '--xla_cpu_use_thunk_runtime=false'` at the beginning of
your jupyter notebook (#570, @michaeldeistler).

### 🧩 New Features

- Add ability to record synaptic currents (#523, @ntolley). Recordings can be turned on
with
```python
net.record("i_IonotropicSynapse")
```

- refactor plotting (#539, @jnsbck).
  - rm networkx dependency
  - add `Network.arrange_in_layers`
  - disentangle moving of cells and plotting in `Network.vis`. To get the same as
  `net.vis(layers=[3,3])`, one now has to do:
```python
net.arrange_in_layers([3,3])
net.vis()
```

- Allow parameter sharing for groups of different sizes, i.e. due to inhomogeneous
numbers of compartments or for synapses with the same (pre-)synaptic parameters but
different numbers of post-synaptic partners. (#514, @jnsbck)

- Add `jaxley.io.graph` for exporting and importing of jaxley modules to and from
`networkx` graph objects (#355, @jnsbck).
  - Adds a new (and improved) SWC reader, which is more flexible and should also be
  easier to extend in the future.
  ```python
  from jaxley.io.graph import swc_to_graph, from_graph
  graph = swc_to_graph(fname)
  # do something to the swc graph, i.e. prune it
  pruned_graph = do_something_to_graph(graph)
  cell = from_graph(pruned_graph, ncomp=4)
  ```
  - Adds a new `to_graph` method for jaxley modules, which exports a module to a
  `networkX` graph. This allows to seamlessly work with `networkX`'s graph manipulation
  or visualization functions.
  - `"graph"` can now also be selected as a backend in the `read_swc`.
  - See the improved SWC reader
  [tutorial](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/08_importing_morphologies.html)
  for more details.

### 🛠️ Code Health

- changelog added to CI (#537, #558, @jnsbck)

- Add regression tests and supporting workflows for maintaining baselines (#475,
#546, @jnsbck).
  - Regression tests can be triggered by commenting "/test_regression" on a PR.
  - Regression tests can be done locally by running
  `NEW_BASELINE=1 pytest -m regression` i.e. on `main` and then `pytest -m regression`
  on `feature`, which will produce a test report (printed to the console and saved
  to .txt).

- Allow inspecting the version via `import jaxley as jx; print(jx.__version__)` (#577,
@michaeldeistler).

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed inconsistency with *type* assertions arising due to `numpy` functions returning
different `dtypes` on platforms like Windows (#567, @Kartik-Sama)

### 🎉 New Contributors

- @ntolley made their first contribution in #523


# 0.5.0

### 🛠️ API changes

- Synapse views no longer exist (#447, #453, @jnsbck). Previous code such as
```python
net.IonotropicSynapse.set("IonotropicSynapse_s", 0.2)
```
must be updated to:
```python
net.set("IonotropicSynapse_s", 0.2)
```
For a more detailed tutorial on how to index synapses, see
[this new tutorial](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/09_advanced_indexing.html).  
- Throughout the codebase, we renamed any occurrence of `seg` (for `segment`) to `comp`
(for `compartment`). The most notable user-facing changes are:
  - `branch = jx.Branch(comp, ncomp=4)`
  - `cell = jx.read_swc(fname, ncomp=4)`
- New defaults for the SWC reader with `jx.read_swc()`. By default, we now have
`assign_groups=True` (previously `False`) and `max_branch_len=None` (previously
`300.0`).
- We renamed `.view` to `.nodes`, e.g., `cell.branch(0).nodes` (#447, #453, @jnsbck).
- We renamed `_update_nodes_with_xyz()` to `compute_compartment_centers()` (#520,
@jnsbck)
- We updated the way in which transformations are built (#455, @manuelgloeckler).
Previous code such as
```python
tf = jx.ParamTransform(
    lower={"radius": 0.1, "length": 2.0},
    lower={"radius": 3.0, "length": 20.0},
)
```
must be updated to:
```python
from jaxley.optimize.transforms import ParamTransform, SigmoidTransform
transforms = [
    {"radius": SigmoidTransform(lower=0.1, upper=3.0)},
    {"length": SigmoidTransform(lower=2.0, upper=20.0)},
]
tf = jt.ParamTransform(transforms)
```

### 🧩 New features

- Added a new `delete_channel()` method (#521, @jnsbck)

net.make_trainable("radius")
params = net.get_parameters()
net.write_trainables(params)
```
- Expose the step function to allow for fine-grained simulation (#466, @manuelgloeckler)
- More flexible and thorough viewing (#447, #453, @jnsbck)

net[r_greater_1].nodes.vis()
```
- check if recordings are empty (#460, @deezer257)
