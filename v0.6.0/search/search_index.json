Other formats like <code>.asc</code> need to be converted to <code>.swc</code> first, for example using the BlueBrain\u2019s morph-tool. For more information on the exact specifications of <code>.swc</code> see here.</p> <pre><code>import jaxley as jx\nimport networkx as nx\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom jaxley.channels import HH\nfrom jaxley.synapses import IonotropicSynapse\n\nfrom jaxley.io.graph import swc_to_graph, make_jaxley_compatible, from_graph, to_graph\n</code></pre> <p>To work with <code>.swc</code> files, <code>Jaxley</code> implements a custom <code>.swc</code> reader. The reader traces the morphology and identifies all uninterrupted sections. These uninterrupted sections are called <code>branches</code> in <code>Jaxley</code>. Each <code>branch</code> is then further partitioned into <code>compartments</code>.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, let\u2019s import an example morphology of a Layer 5 pyramidal cell and visualize it.</p> <pre><code># import swc file into jx.Cell object\nfname = \"data/morph.swc\"\ncell = jx.read_swc(fname, ncomp=8)  # Use eight compartments per branch.\n\n# print shape (num_branches, num_comps)\nprint(cell.shape)\n\ncell.show()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(157, 1256)\n</code></pre> local_comp_index global_comp_index local_branch_index global_branch_index local_cell_index global_cell_index 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1251 3 1251 156 156 0 0 1252 4 1252 156 156 0 0 1253 5 1253 156 156 0 0 1254 6 1254 156 156 0 0 1255 7 1255 156 156 0 0 <p>1256 rows \u00d7 6 columns</p> <p>As we can see, this yields a morphology that is approximated by 1256 compartments. Depending on the amount of detail that you need, you can also change the number of compartments in each branch:</p> <pre><code>cell = jx.read_swc(fname, ncomp=2)\n\n# print shape (num_branches, num_comps)\nprint(cell.shape)\n\ncell.show()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(157, 314)\n</code></pre> local_comp_index global_comp_index local_branch_index global_branch_index local_cell_index global_cell_index 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 1 0 0 3 1 3 1 1 0 0 4 0 4 2 2 0 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 309 1 309 154 154 0 0 310 0 310 155 155 0 0 311 1 311 155 155 0 0 312 0 312 156 156 0 0 313 1 313 156 156 0 0 <p>314 rows \u00d7 6 columns</p> <p>The above assigns the same number of compartments to every branch.

This means we can also for example use <code>vis</code> to highlight each branch. This can be done by iterating over each branch index and calling <code>cell.branch(i).vis()</code>. Within the loop.</p> <pre><code>fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(5, 5))\n# define colorwheel with 10 colors\ncolors = plt.cm.tab10.colors\nfor i, branch in enumerate(cell.branches):\n    branch.vis(ax=ax, color=colors[i % 10])\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.title(\"Branches\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>While we only use two compartments to approximate each branch in this example, we can see the morphology is still plotted in great detail. This is because we always plot the full <code>.swc</code> reconstruction irrespective of the number of compartments used. The morphology lives seperately in the <code>cell.xyzr</code> attribute in a per branch fashion. </p> <p>In addition to plotting the full morphology of the cell using points <code>vis(type=\"scatter\")</code> or lines <code>vis(type=\"line\")</code>, <code>Jaxley</code> also supports plotting a detailed morphological <code>vis(type=\"morph\")</code> or approximate compartmental reconstruction <code>vis(type=\"comp\")</code> that correctly considers the thickness of the neurite. Note that <code>\"comp\"</code> plots the lengths of each compartment which is equal to the length of the traced neurite. While neurites can be zigzaggy, the compartments that approximate them are straight lines. This can lead to miss-aligment of the compartment ends. For details see the documentation of <code>vis</code>. </p> <p>The morphologies can either be projected onto 2D or also rendered in 3D. </p> <pre><code># visualize the cell\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(10, 3), layout=\"constrained\", sharex=True, sharey=True)\ncell.vis(ax=ax[0], type=\"morph\", dims=[0,1])\ncell.vis(ax=ax[1], type=\"comp\", dims=[0,1])\ncell.vis(ax=ax[2], type=\"scatter\", dims=[0,1], s=1)\ncell.vis(ax=ax[3], type=\"line\", dims=[0,1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Comparison of plot types\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <pre><code># set to interactive mode\n# %matplotlib notebook\n</code></pre> <pre><code># plot in 3D\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\ncell.vis(ax=ax, type=\"line\", dims=[2,0,1])\nax.view_init(elev=20, azim=5)\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Since <code>Jaxley</code> supports grouping different branches or compartments together, we can also use the <code>id</code> labels provided by the <code>.swc</code> file to assign group labels to the <code>jx.Cell</code> object.</p> <pre><code>print(list(cell.groups.keys()))\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(5, 5))\ncolors = plt.cm.tab10.colors\ncell.basal.vis(ax=ax, color=colors[2])\ncell.soma.vis(ax=ax, color=colors[1])\ncell.apical.vis(ax=ax, color=colors[0])\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.title(\"Groups\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>['soma', 'basal', 'apical', 'custom']\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>To build a network of morphologically detailed cells, we can now connect several reconstructed cells together and also visualize the network.

In these cases graphs present a natural way to represent and work with neural morphologies, allowing for easy fixing, pruning, smoothing and traversal of neural morphologies on the fly. For this purpose <code>Jaxley</code> also comes with a seperate <code>networkX</code> toolset, that allows for easy interoperability between <code>networkX</code> graphs and <code>Jaxley</code> Modules.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, let\u2019s first define a simple morphology via a networkX graph.</p> <pre><code>nodes = {\n    0: {\"id\":1, \"x\": -1, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 2.0},\n    1: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 2.0},\n    2: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 1, \"y\": 0, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 2.0},\n    3: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 2, \"y\": 1, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 1.0},\n    4: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 3, \"y\": 2, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 1.0},\n    5: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 2, \"y\": -1, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 1.0},\n    6: {\"id\":1, \"x\": 3, \"y\": -2, \"z\": 0, \"r\": 1.0},\n} \nedges = ((0, 1),(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(2, 5),(5, 6))\n\ng = nx.DiGraph()\ng.add_nodes_from(nodes.items())\ng.add_edges_from(edges, l=1)\n\n# Setting any of these attributes is optional.

This means we can use <code>io.graph</code> to import it into a <code>jx.Module</code> using the <code>from_graph</code> method.</p> <pre><code>cell = from_graph(g, ncomp=2)\n\ncell.vis()\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>To work with more complex morphologies <code>io.graph</code> also provides a way to import <code>swc</code> reconstructions as graphs. This means we can easily view the entire tracing of the morphology. At this stage the <code>networkX</code> graph could also easily be fixed, pruned or smoothed. To demo this lets remove the apical dendrites (id=4).</p> <pre><code>fname = \"data/morph.swc\"\ngraph = swc_to_graph(fname)\n\n# manipulate the graph\nids = nx.get_node_attributes(graph, \"id\")\nids = {k: v for k, v in ids.items() if v != 4}\ngraph = nx.subgraph(graph, ids).copy()\n\npos = {k: (v[\"x\"], v[\"y\"]) for k, v in graph.nodes.items()}\nnx.draw(graph.to_undirected(), pos=pos, node_size=20)\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>To make the traced and possibly edited morphology compatible with <code>Jaxley</code> <code>from_graph</code> segments it into branches and then divides the branches up into compartments. This is done by <code>make_jaxley_compatible</code> (called at the beginning og <code>from_graph</code>), which produces a subgraph of the original morphology and adds additional attributes that <code>Jaxley</code> requires to simulate it (see the documentation of <code>make_jaxley_compatible</code> for details). </p> <p>Let\u2019s see what this looks like.</p> <pre><code>graph = make_jaxley_compatible(graph)\n\nprint(f\"node attributes {graph.nodes[0]}\")\nprint(f\"edge attributes {graph.edges[(0, 1)]}\")\n\npos = {k: (v[\"x\"], v[\"y\"]) for k, v in graph.nodes.items()}\nnx.draw(graph.to_undirected(), pos=pos, with_labels=True, font_size=7, node_size=150)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>node attributes {'x': 0.0, 'y': 0.0, 'z': 0.0, 'branch_index': 0, 'comp_index': 0, 'groups': ['soma'], 'radius': 8.119000434875488, 'length': 0.025, 'cell_index': 0}\nedge attributes {'l': 0.001, 'type': 'intra_branch'}\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Again we can use the <code>from_graph</code> function to convert the graph into a <code>Cell</code> object, which <code>Jaxley</code> can then simulate or optimize. </p> <pre><code>cell = from_graph(graph, ncomp=2)\n\n# add mechanism to cell\ncell.insert(HH())\n\n# change parameters, pretending the cell has been optimized\nfor branch in cell:\n    y_pos = branch.xyzr[0][0,1]\n    branch.set(\"HH_gNa\", 0.5 + 0.5 * y_pos)\n</code></pre> <p>To close the loop <code>Jaxley</code> also offers the option to export any <code>Module</code> to a <code>networkX</code> graph object. This ability offers another way to store or share the current Module state, since <code>to_graph</code> attaches all relevant attributes to the nodes and eges of the graph. It can also be used to make more complex visualizations, using any of these attributes i.e. channel densities very easily.</p> <pre><code>graph = to_graph(cell, channels=True)\n\n# plot of the cell, coloring each node according to the sodium conductance\npos = {k: (v[\"x\"], v[\"y\"]) for k, v in graph.nodes.items()}\nnx.draw(graph.to_undirected(), pos=pos, node_color=[graph.nodes[n][\"HH_gNa\"] for n in graph.nodes], cmap=\"viridis\", with_labels=False, node_size=50)\nplt.title(\"Sodium conductance\")\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Congrats!
