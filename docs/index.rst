Welcome to Jaxley!
===================

``Jaxley`` is a differentiable simulator for biophysical neuron models in `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_. Its key features are:

- automatic differentiation, allowing gradient-based optimization of thousands of parameters  
- support for CPU, GPU, or TPU without any changes to the code  
- ``jit``-compilation, making it as fast as other packages while being fully written in python  
- backward-Euler solver for stable numerical solution of multicompartment neurons  
- elegant mechanisms for parameter sharing


Getting started
---------------

``Jaxley`` allows to simulate biophysical neuron models on CPU, GPU, or TPU:

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from jax import config

   import jaxley as jx
   from jaxley.channels import HH

   config.update("jax_platform_name", "cpu")  # Or "gpu" / "tpu".

   cell = jx.Cell()  # Define cell.
   cell.insert(HH())  # Insert channels.

   current = jx.step_current(i_delay=1.0, i_dur=1.0, i_amp=0.1, delta_t=0.025, t_max=10.0)
   cell.stimulate(current)  # Stimulate with step current.
   cell.record("v")  # Record voltage.

   v = jx.integrate(cell)  # Run simulation.
   plt.plot(v.T)  # Plot voltage trace.

For more resources, see the `FAQ <https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ or `Advanced tutorials <https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_tutorials.html>`_.


Installation
------------

``Jaxley`` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/jaxley/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install jaxley

This will install ``Jaxley`` with CPU support. If you want GPU support, follow the instructions on the `JAX github repository <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ to install `JAX` with GPU support (in addition to installing ``Jaxley``). For example, for NVIDIA GPUs, run

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"


Feedback and Contributions
--------------------------

We welcome any feedback on how ``Jaxley`` is working for your neuron models and are happy to receive bug reports, pull requests and other feedback (see `contribute <https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_). We wish to maintain a positive community, please read our `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.
