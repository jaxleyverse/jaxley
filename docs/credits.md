## Important dependencies and prior art

- `Jaxley` greatly benefited from previous toolboxes for simulating multicompartment neurons, in particular [`NEURON`](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn).
- `Jaxley` is built upon the [`JAX`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/) machine learning framework, developed by Google.
- `Jaxley` makes heavy use of [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) for tracking parameters.
- `Jaxley` uses [`networkX`](https://networkx.org) for handling morphologies.
