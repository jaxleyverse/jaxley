# What kinds of models can be implemented in Jaxley?

`Jaxley` focuses on biophysical, Hodgkin-Huxley-type models. You can think of `Jaxley` like [the `NEURON` simulator](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) written in `JAX`.

`Jaxley` allows to simulate the following types of models, as well as networks thereof:

- single-compartment (point neuron) Hodgkin-Huxley models
- multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models
- rate-based neuron models (tutorial [here](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/question_04.html))

For all of these models, `Jaxley` is flexible and accurate. For example, it can flexibly [add new channel models](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/05_channel_and_synapse_models.html), use [different kinds of synapses (conductance-based, tanh, ...)](https://github.com/jaxleyverse/jaxley/tree/main/jaxley/synapses), it can [insert different kinds of channels in different branches](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/01_morph_neurons.html) (or compartments) within single cells, and it can [simulate complex ion dynamics (diffusion, pumps,...)](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/11_ion_dynamics.html). Like `NEURON`, `Jaxley` implements a backward-Euler solver for stable numerical solution of multi-compartment neurons.

In addition to these biophysical neuron models, `Jaxley` can also simulate simplified models, see the tutorial [here](https://jaxley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/05_channel_and_synapse_models.html). In particular, `Jaxley` supports:
- Leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons,  
- Izhikevich neurons,  
- Rate-based neurons.  

`Jaxley` also supports networks of these neurons.

Note that, for LIF and Izhikevich neuron models, `Jaxley` does not yet support surrogate gradient descent, which is required for efficient training to due the discontinuity of spikes in these models.
