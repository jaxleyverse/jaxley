# A toy SWC file written by @michaeldeistler. It creates a single branches where the
# first node (think of the soma) is much thicker than the rest. However, all type_ids
# are the same, so they get lumped into one branch. This is an important test case
# to check if area, and axial resistivities get computed correctly. See #650.
