# SWC dummy file written by @michaeldeistler.
#
# This SWC file is the counterpiece to `morph_somatic_branchpoint.swc`. It has 
# the exact same structure, but all nodes that are marked as `soma` in
# `morph_somatic_branchpoint.swc` are marked as apical dendrite here. As such
# NEURON (and Jaxley) interpret the two files differently.
