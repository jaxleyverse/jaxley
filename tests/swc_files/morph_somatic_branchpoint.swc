# SWC dummy file written by @michaeldeistler.
#
# This SWC file contains a "somatic branchpoint". This is a point
# which is connected to at least two other somatic nodes (type_id=1),
# but it is also connected to at least one node of other types. In
# such cases, the NEURON simulator does not consider the branchpoint
# to be a part of the additional branch of another type.
#
# For good measure, this file also contains a branch (of type-id 3)
# which is connected to a soma, but not to a somatic branchpoint. This
# branch, therefore, starts at the final somatic node.
