class IonotropicSynapse(Synapse):
    """
    Compute synaptic current and update synapse state for a generic ionotropic synapse.

    The synapse state "s" is the probability that a postsynaptic receptor channel is
    open, and this depends on the amount of neurotransmitter released, which is in turn
    dependent on the presynaptic voltage.

    The synaptic parameters are:
        - gS: the maximal conductance across the postsynaptic membrane
        - e_syn: the reversal potential across the postsynaptic membrane
        - k_minus: the rate constant of neurotransmitter unbinding from the postsynaptic
            receptor

    Details of this implementation can be found in the following book chapter:
        L. F. Abbott and E. Marder, "Modeling Small Networks," in Methods in Neuronal
        Modeling, C. Koch and I. Sergev, Eds. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1998.
