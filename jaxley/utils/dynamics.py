def build_utils_for_dynamic_states(module) -> Tuple[Callable, Callable, Callable]:
    r"""Returns three utility functions which can be used to convert states to a vector.

    These utility functions are meant to be used together with 
    ``jx.integrate.build_init_and_step_fn``. The ``init_fn`` returned by
    ``build_init_and_step_fn`` returns an ``all_states``, which is a dictionary
    of all states, including the voltages at branchpoints and the channel and synapse
    currents. The utility functions returned by ``build_utils_for_dynamic_states()``
    modify the ``all_states`` as follows:

    - They remove all channel currents, syanpse currents, and branchpoint voltages
      (which can be computed from compartment voltages). As such, only "true" dynamic
      states remain.
    - They return the states as a flat array. This allows easier interoperability
      with frameworks such as ``dynamax``.

    Args:
        module: A ``Module`` object that e.g. a cell.
        params: Trainable parameters of the neuron model.
        param_state: Parameters returned by ``data_set``. Defaults to None.
        voltage_solver: Voltage solver used in step.
        solver: ODE solver.
        delta_t: Time step.

    Returns:

        * **states_to_pytree** -  Function to convert the state vector back to a pytree.
        * **states_to_full_pytree** -  Function to convert the state vector back to a
          pytree and restore observables.
        * **full_pytree_to_states** -  Function to convert the full state pytree to a
          vector and filter observables.

    Example usage
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Example 1: Use `full_pytree_to_states` to build a vector of dynamics states. Use
    `states_to_full_pytree` to convert the vector back to the `states` dictionary.

    ::

        import jaxley as jx
        from jaxley.integrate import build_init_and_step_fn
        from jaxley.utils.dynamics import build_step_dynamics_fn

        cell = jx.Cell()
        params = cell.get_parameters()

        build_step_dynamics_fn()
        build_init_and_step_fn()

        all_states, all_params = init_fn(params)

        dynamic_states = full_pytree_to_states(all_states)
        recovered_all_states = states_to_pytree(dynamic_states)

    Example 2: Use `states_to_pytree` to idetify the names of states in the vector
    valued dynamic states.

    ::

        import jaxley as jx
        from jaxley.integrate import build_init_and_step_fn
        from jaxley.utils.dynamics import build_step_dynamics_fn

        cell = jx.Cell()
        params = cell.get_parameters()

        build_step_dynamics_fn()
        build_init_and_step_fn()

        all_states, all_params = init_fn(params)

        dynamic_states = full_pytree_to_states(full_states_pytree)

        # Recover the names of states in the `dynamic_states`.
        states_pytree = states_to_pytree(dynamic_states)

    Example 3: Build a `step_dynamics` function and use it to compute the Jacobian
    of a single step.

    ::

        from jax import jacfwd
        import jaxley as jx
        from jaxley.utils.dynamics import build_step_dynamics_fn
        from jaxley.channels import Leak

        comp = jx.Compartment()
        branch = jx.Branch(comp, 8)
        cell = jx.Cell(branch, parents=[-1, 0, 0])
        cell.insert(Leak())
        cell.to_jax()

        states_vec, step_dynamics_fn, _, _, _ = build_step_dynamics_fn(
            cell, solver="bwd_euler", delta_t=0.025
        )
        jacobian = jacfwd(step_dynamics_fn)(states_vec)
