    Build a new graph made up of compartments in every branch. These compartments are

    Example: 4 compartments | edges = - | nodes = o | comp_nodes = x
    o-----------o----------o---o---o---o--------o
    o-------x---o----x-----o--xo---o---ox-------o

    This function returns a _directed_ graph. The graph is directed only because every
    compartment tracks the xyzr coordinates of the associated SWC file. These xyzr
    coordinates are ordered by the order of the traversal of the swc_graph. In later
    methods (e.g. build_solve_graph), we traverse the `comp_graph` and mostly ignore
    the directionality of the edges, but we only use the directionality to reverse the
    xyzr coordinates if necessary.

    Args:
        swc_graph: Graph generated by `to_swc_graph()`.
        ncomp: How many compartments per branch to insert.
        root: The root branch from which to start tracing the nodes. This defines the
            branch indices.
        min_radius: Minimal radius for each compartment.
        max_len: Maximal length for each branch. Longer branches are split into
            separate branches.
        ignore_swc_tracing_interruptions: If `False`, it this function automatically
            starts a new branch when a section is traced with interruptions.
        relevant_type_ids: All type ids that are not in this list will be ignored for
            tracing the morphology. This means that branches which have multiple type
            ids (which are not in `relevant_type_ids`) will be considered as one branch.
            If `None`, we default to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
